# Coding-Self-Challenge

💪 Welcome to my Self-Challenge Coding, where I put every of my projects that I have done so far during my free time to enhance my technical skills as a student who is working towards my goal of being a Product Manager ✨. 

💡 My rules for myself are pretty simple, just in order to give myself flexibility but also a push towards a better understanding of coding in the least pressure, making it a hobby 🥳 rather than a MUST 😵‍💫: 

📌 Finish every project that I start <br>
📌 Set a timer to record the progress <br>
📌 Do it everyday - even if it is for 15-30 minutes (psst, I realize you don't have to spend THAT much time a day to code in order to become better) <br>
📌 Use class's projects, side projects, personal projects, and hackathon's projects as bases for the projects in the Challenge! (And, it's not a cheat key, because I still learn from each of these anyway! Sounds fun and productive!) <br>

Thanks for tuning in!
