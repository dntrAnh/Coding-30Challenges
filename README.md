DAY 1 of 
# Coding-Self-Challenge

Time taken: 30 minutes

Level: Easy-Intermediate 

Tutorial from: https://www.codedex.io/projects/create-a-to-do-list-app-with-html-css-js

This is the very first project of Coding Self-Challenge starting from my Spring Break in 2024. 
My first project is pretty simple. I followed the indicated tutorials as well as adding in some of my preferences over colors and animations to make the to-do list more of my own.
